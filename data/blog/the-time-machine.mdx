        -Dsonar.java.pmd.reportPaths=target/pmd-result.sarif \

# Deploy stage
deploy-job:

“Explanation
Build Stage:

build-job: Uses a Maven Docker image to clean and package the application. Artifacts (compiled JAR files) are stored for use in later stages.
Test Stage:

unit-test-job: Runs unit tests and stores the results as JUnit reports.
integration-test-job: Runs integration tests and stores the results as JUnit reports.
lint-job: Runs Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs for static code analysis. Stores the XML reports as artifacts. The job is allowed to fail without stopping the pipeline.
Scan Stage:

dependency-scan-job: Uses the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven plugin to scan for vulnerable dependencies. Stores the report as an artifact.
convert-reports: Converts XML reports from Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs to SARIF format.
sonarQube-analysis: Uses the SonarQube scanner to upload SARIF reports to SonarQube.
Deploy Stage:

deploy-job: Deploys the application. This job only runs on the master branch.
Additional Notes
SARIF Conversion Tools: Ensure that the SARIF conversion JAR files are available at the specified paths. You may need to download or build these tools from the SARIF SDK.
SonarQube Configuration: Replace placeholders like your_project_key, your_sonarqube_server, and your_sonar_token with actual values.
Security Scanning: You might want to add additional security scanning tools based on your project needs.
By following this setup, you will have a robust CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, scans, and deploys your Java Spring Boot microservice.”
